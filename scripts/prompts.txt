Generate a sample set of 50 products for climbing, including carabiners of different sizes, materials and colors, ropes, safety devices, clothing and others. Output this information in JSON format following this style:  

[  
 { "id": "unique_id", "description": "a product description with 5 to 25 words", "category": "product category" }  
]

Now use the same format, but add a field called "manual" with approximately 100 words per product.
